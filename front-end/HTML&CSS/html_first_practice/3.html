<h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
  language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is
  high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
  curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
  and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the
  core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web
   pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
   use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated
   JavaScript engine to execute it.
